# Final-Project-Cedar-and-Shuping Documentation

This repository contains files and folders essential for the project, organized as follows:

## Scripts and Notebooks

- **`qwen.py`**  
  A Python script designed to run on a local LM Studio environment. This script uses the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model for active learning labeling.

- **`finetuning.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook used in Google Colab for training and fine-tuning a BERT model. Due to its size, the resulting model is stored on Google Drive. The link to access it is provided in the `final_project.qmd` file.

- **`evaluation.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook used in Google Colab to evaluate environmental sentiments in government reports.

- **`final_project.qmd`**  
  The main file that consolidates data wrangling, plotting, and includes the link to the fine-tuned BERT model.
