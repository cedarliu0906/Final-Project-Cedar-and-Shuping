## Introduction

China’s 2012 Energy Policy White Paper outlined a transformative energy strategy to reduce carbon emissions, enhance renewable energy integration, and support sustainable development. This review evaluates the policy’s effectiveness over a decade, focusing on renewable energy adoption and its impact on carbon emissions per GDP.

The key research question is: **To what extent have China's energy policies influenced renewable energy adoption and reduced carbon emissions intensity at national and provincial levels?**

## Research Approach

The analysis involved compiling datasets on China's renewable energy adoption (2012–2022) and carbon emissions per GDP by province, from China Energy Statistical Yearbook. Geographical data was integrated using shapefiles to facilitate visualizations. Nationwide trends and provincial variations in renewable energy percentage and carbon emissions were assessed, and analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between renewable energy adoption and carbon emissions. Visualizations were developed using both static and interactive tools, including Shiny applications for dynamic analysis. The data preparation process required significant preprocessing, particularly for provincial data translation and merging, and relied on proxies for some renewable energy types due to measurement limitations.


## Findings

### 1. National and Provincial Renewable Energy Growth (2012–2022)

Renewable energy adoption increased steadily over the decade, driven primarily by hydropower and solar energy expansion. The share of renewable energy rose from 4.40% in 2012 to 18.10% in 2022, achieving significant policy targets set in 2012. This growth highlights the effectiveness of centralized investments in hydropower and solar energy and underscores the importance of continuing subsidies and grid development to support renewables.

The geograph shows regional disparities and outliers reveal underlying complexities. For example, Qinghai, Tibet, and Gansu stand out with the darkest green shades, reflecting the highest average renewable energy percentages due to abundant natural resources like hydropower and solar energy. Coastal provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian exhibit moderate renewable energy adoption, constrained by their significant industrial bases that limit the share of renewables compared to total energy consumption. In contrast, eastern provinces like Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Shandong are among the lightest-shaded regions, indicating lower average renewable energy percentages due to their heavy reliance on fossil fuels to meet the demands of dense urban and industrial populations.

## Policy Implications

China’s energy policies have successfully fostered renewable energy adoption and reduced carbon intensity, aligning with its international commitments. However, regional disparities and coal dependency in inner provinces remain significant barriers. Enhanced support for lagging regions and diversification of renewable energy types can further strengthen progress.

## Future Directions

### 1. Data Improvements
- Develop finer-grained data on renewable energy types (e.g., wind, solar).
- Incorporate economic and industrial variables for a more nuanced analysis.

### 2. Policy Expansion
- Explore offshore wind and distributed solar energy as emerging areas.
- Increase investment in grid modernization to accommodate renewable sources.

### 3. Interactive Tools
- Expand Shiny applications for global comparisons and predictive modeling.
